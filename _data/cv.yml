      year: May 3 - Aug 20 2021
      description:
        - title: Implemented a modified Tiny Video Network (TVN) for video-based Ejection Fraction measurement in echocardiography.
          contents:
            - Achieved a comparable accuracy with the contemporary state-of-the-art video-based model (the Echonet-Dynamic approach), while having a 100 times smaller model size.
            - Embedded aleatoric uncertainty in the network to model the inherent noise and ambiguity of EF labels in echo data to improve the prediction's robustness.
            - The proposed network is suitable for real-time video-based EF estimation compatible with portable mobile devices and is deployed for Point-of-Care ultrasound system in Vancouver General Hospital.
        - Submitted a related paper for 2022 SPIE Medical Imaging Conference.

    - title: Assistant Engineer
      institution: Huawei Technologies Canada
      year: May 7 - Dec 31 2020
      description:
        - title: Developed an end-to-end Model Composition system that is able to combine an arbitrary number of neural networks with arbitrary architectures.
          contents:
            - The system does not require ground-truth annotations from the original data, or any knowledge of input model weights or code.
            - It does not place any restrictions on the type and number of object categories of the input models.
        - Facilitated in implementing a self-labeling adaptation system that improves the robustness of object detection models against image corruptions without the need for labeled images from the target test domain.
        - Worked with colleagues to submit conference (ICCV & BMVC) papers and apply for patents.
