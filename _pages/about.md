I am a first-year Master student in the Computational Science and Engineering Program at Harvard University. Before coming to Harvard, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at University of British Columbia for my undergraduate, where I had the honor to work in the Robotics and Control (RCL) Lab with Prof. [Purang Abolmaesumi](https://ece.ubc.ca/purang-abolmaesumi/) on the [Light-Weight Deep Video Network](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12034/120341I/A-light-weight-deep-video-network--towards-robust-assessment/10.1117/12.2611176.short?SSO=1).

<!-- which has been selected for oral presentation in the 2022 SPIE and won the outstanding paper award.   -->

I also worked at the Big Data and Intelligence Platform at Huawei Vancouver Research Center. Together with the Applied AI Team, I developed methods for Machine Learning [Model Composition](https://www.bmvc2021-virtualconference.com/assets/papers/0508.pdf) and [Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13389).

I love doing research :) Facing challenges and finding ways out of obstacles are fun like solving puzzles and I enjoy every part of it. I'm actively seeking research opportunities, pls feel free to contact me if you are interested in corporation.

In my free time I like reading books, watching files, eating good food with friends, hiking, going to museums and galleries. My favorite artist is [Nicolas Party](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/exhibitions/nicolas-party-lheure-mauve/) and I hope one day I can make such stunning creations using Computer Technologies.

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->
